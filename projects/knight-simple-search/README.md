## Knight simple search
The Knight Shortest Path Problem is a classic puzzle that asks the following question: given a chessboard of dimensions n x n and two positions on the board, what is the shortest path that a knight can take to get from the starting position to the ending position? A knight moves in an L-shape, two steps in one direction and then one step in a perpendicular direction.

In this repository, we present a Python implementation of the Knight Shortest Path Problem using the A* algorithm. The A* algorithm is a popular heuristic search algorithm used to find the shortest path between two points. It is a combination of Dijkstra's algorithm, which finds the shortest path between two points in a graph, and a heuristic function, which estimates the distance between a node and the goal.

Our implementation takes as input the starting and ending positions on the chessboard and returns the shortest path that a knight can take to get from the starting position to the ending position.
